Artificial intelligence is no longer reserved for tech giants. Discover how SMBs can leverage AI to improve their operations and competitiveness.

## AI accessible to businesses

Today, AI has become accessible to all businesses thanks to:

- **Cloud APIs**: OpenAI, Google Cloud AI, Azure Cognitive Services
- **No-code/low-code solutions**: Tools allowing AI integration without technical expertise
- **Pre-trained models**: Ready-to-use solutions for common use cases

## Concrete use cases

### 1. Automated customer service

AI-powered chatbots can handle up to 80% of common customer requests:

```javascript
// Example of chatbot integration with OpenAI
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a customer service assistant..." },
    { role: "user", content: userMessage }
  ]
});
```

### 2. Predictive analytics

Anticipate market trends and optimize your inventory:

- Demand forecasting

### 3. Document automation

AI can automatically extract, classify, and process your documents:

- Intelligent OCR

## Steps to get started

1. **Identify a specific problem**: Start small with a well-defined use case
2. **Evaluate existing solutions**: Often, turnkey solutions exist
